# ![Slot logo](public/assets/faveicon.png) Flix Reviews
So here is Flix Reviews a colab school project. We have a site you can search for all movies old or new and not even out yet. Then get back information about the movies you want. Maybe just leave a review or add a movie to your favorite. Did you catch that last trailer for that upcomming blockbuster? If not we got have you covered the latest trailers inside.

## Why a movie site
Why not? No in all honesty it was just a project that sounded fun to do and we really wanted to use **TMDB API**. It also was a project that i belived in the 6 days we had to get a full **CRUD** app done that this project would fit perfect into that that time frame.
